# Text Editors

Text editors allow a coder to organize their work, as well as perform their work more efficiently. This is accomplished by various means such as:
- Code Completion `provides suggestions to autofill`
- Syntax Highlighting `changes the color of certain text to make it easier to read and determine errors in coding`
- Themes `changes the background and text colors to optimize workflow and reduce eye fatigue`
- Extensions `are a form of plugins that boost the capabilities of the text editor`

It is important for coders to find a text editor that they are comfortable working with. Just like food preferences to sustain one's health and happiness, text editors come in many different forms but utlimately provide similar end results.
