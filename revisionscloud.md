Version Control System (VCS):
- Is a system that allows you to revisit versions of a file or file set by recording changes. By utilizing this, mistakes can easily be fixed.

- Types of VCS:
  - Local VCS - Entails one database on your HD that stores changes.
  - Centralized VCS - This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.
  - Distributed VCS - A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
