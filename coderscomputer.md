# The Command Line/Terminal

This is your text-based control center, or interface more appropriately. You can create files, look at file, move files and so much more (I'm still learning). Here, you can give it commands to follow, and it will respond to those commands given (If done correctly).

pwd = Print Working Directory (where you are)
ls = List (what's in your current location)
cd = Change Directory (move to another file)

Paths are the means to get to a particular file and there are two types:

- Absolute Path 
  - Specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

- Relative Path
  - specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.

file: obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

ls -a: List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

Everything is a file under Linux, even directories.

Linux is an extensionless system, and files can have any extension they like or none at all.

Linux is case sensitive, beware of silly typos.
