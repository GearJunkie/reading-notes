# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users, such as colors, font-size, spacing/layout. It is used to change the basic style of the HTML markup, personalizing the web page.

            h1  {
                color: red
                font-size: 5em
            }
