This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes.

## About Me

My name is Jesse. I am a new student at CodeFellows.

### Growth Mindset

To me, growth mindset is the ability to adapt and overcomve challenges and obstacles.

- These three reminders will help me grow:
  - Remain open minded
  - Practice what you learn
  - Collaborate with others

### Markdown

This is a coding language that I'm learning to use in GitHub to format text used in web pages. I will keep you updated on my progress. Be sure to check out my markdown page below.
